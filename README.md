There is a large dependency of cases in our country. The time taken runs into years more as a norm rather than an exception. Majority of the cases would be os a repeated nature, with previous decisions available for guidance. Creation of database of all judgements in various cases and creation of a smart legal aid using AI / block chain would help in assessing the condition of each petition and thus may enable reduction in timelines. Any other technology based solution to reduce pendency timelines may also be identified. Technology could also be available to advise common citizens so as to enable them to understand where they stand before they file their petitions. It should also be able to predict the likely timelines for a case to see its final judgment, when petitioned in a court of law.
